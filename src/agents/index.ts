/**
 * Go - Multi-Agent System
 *
 * Agent configuration exports and utilities.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Each Telegram forum topic maps to a specialized agent
 * - Agents have distinct system prompts, reasoning styles, and tool access
 * - General topic (no thread_id) uses the default Orchestrator agent
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Create a Telegram group with forum topics enabled
 * 2. Add your bot as admin
 * 3. Map topic IDs to agent names in topicAgentMap (src/agents/base.ts)
 * 4. Messages in each topic will use that agent's configuration
